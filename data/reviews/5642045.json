I'm more convinced now that this is\nindeed the case.\n\n> Then you'd use default_goroot here instead of goroot_final.\n> The dist tool wouldn't even know about $GOROOT_FINAL;\n> only the build script would, while preparing the arguments\n> to cc during the build of dist itself.\n\nI went into the opposite direction, as that allows us to get rid of\nthe idea of a default_root entirely, and live with a single concept.\n\nPTAL to see what you think. I've successfully built the Ubuntu\npackages with this change, and the same compiled binaries (including\ndist) work before installing with $GOROOT set, and also after\ninstalling without $GOROOT.\n\n-- \nGustavo Niemeyer\nhttp://niemeyer.net\nhttp://niemeyer.net/plus\nhttp://niemeyer.net/twitter\nhttp://niemeyer.net/blog\n\n-- I'm not absolutely sure of anything.\n",
