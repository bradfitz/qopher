The libc interface (for example, on i386 the code in src/lib/libc/i386/sys/pipe.S) converts this into the form that is documented in the man page.\n\nI think that we probably do not want to officially support Go on NetBSD until after the 6.0 release - we simply cannot run on 5.1, so we're currently running on 5.99.x or current. However, having said that I do not see any reason not to use pipe() instead of pipe2() - it was just convenient since it was semantically similar to the code that it was cloned from (FWIW pipe2 was added around a year ago).\n\nIs this the only thing stopping Go from running on your machine?",
