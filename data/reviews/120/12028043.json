Most people, however, are probably using go-mode by loading the file that comes with a Go installation. Shockingly enough, a lot of people who use emacs don't actually know a lot about emacs. \n\nWhen I removed the install instructions in go-mode-load.el, I was actually asked to add them back as well.\n\n> \n> > Keeping the file up to date isn't much work since the set of functions\n> > you'd call in a non go-mode buffer are few and relatively fixed.\n> \n> Write a Makefile to generate it (possibly byte-compiling go-mode.el\n> while at it) then.  What do you gain by versioning it?\n\nThere is no benefit to versioning it. I myself found the presence of the file silly when I took over go-mode and rewrote it. That's not the point though. There definitely are people who followed the instructions and point their .emacs at the go-mode-load.el file from a copy of the repository or an installation of Go. If you remove the file, there setups will break on the next update. Keeping the file, to me, is purely for legacy reasons.",
