From our point of view, this is freebsd not linux as GOOS talks about the kernel syscall interface, not the userspace (although cgo alters that). As debian/kFreeBSD is experimental at this time, I do not think it is worth the effort of duplicating all the freebsd specific code so this is proposal represents a reasonable workaround.\n\nCurrently cgo is not supported, make.bash will detect this and disable cgo automatically during the build.\n\ndfc@debian:~/go/src$ uname -a\nGNU/kFreeBSD debian 8.1-1-686 #0 Sat Jul 21 17:02:04 UTC 2012 i686 i386 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2415M CPU @ 2.30GHz GNU/kFreeBSD\ndfc@debian:~/go/src$ ../bin/go version\ngo version devel +d05272f402ec Sat Dec 01 15:15:14 2012 -0800\n\nTested with GOOS=freebsd GOARCH=386",

Detecting debian/kFreeBSD from uname -s was straight forward so I've added the logic into make.bash to disable cgo there.",
