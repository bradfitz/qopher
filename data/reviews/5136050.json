			"text": "Hi Kishore,\n\nyou've made a huge work, but there's a big problem. You have modified the source code of the internal go image package. I'm not responsible of this package and we do not have to change this package. The change have to be made in draw2d package and is a minor change compared to what you've done with image package. Sorry I 've misunderstood your last mails.\nThe change have to be written in this file : http://code.google.com/p/draw2d/source/browse/draw2d/paint.go not in image package.\n\n\nsorry for the confusion, and keep it simple.\nLaurent\n\n\nLe 28 sept. 2011 \u00e0 09:56, kishoreBE@gmail.com a \u00e9crit :\n\n> Reviewers: llg,\n> \n> Message:\n> Hello legoff.laurent@gmail.com (cc: golang-dev@googlegroups.com),\n> \n> I'd like you to review this change to\n> https://code.google.com/p/go/\n> \n> \n> Description:\n> This changes are due to change in the color.go file.
