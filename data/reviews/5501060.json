It has side effects, as it will link everything against pthread. A better direction would be to replace the uses of -lpthread with -pthread at the sites that actually use pthread.",

Thanks for checking.  We use -mthread on Windows, as that\nseems to be the magic incantation, so I think it will all work.\n",
