Since these are constants, I cannot think of a problem it would cause, but it would give more public visibility in godoc about what is supported.  If you think they should remain unexported, I will reverse this part of the CL.\n\nAnd as of now, yes, I do believe we support all of the things I am exporting with this CL.  Previously, we had unexported ecdsa references, but did not support them.",
