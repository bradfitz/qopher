			"text": "Hi Mikio,\n\nI share rsc's concern about adding an extra package which lives on in  Go 1.x even if it is no longer needed. Understanding that the std lib can't depend on 3rd party libs, it is also not acceptable to add more public symbols to pkg/net so they can be used by the go.net/ipv{4,6} packages. Does that mean a copy and paste job ? and if so, what is the best way to arrange the code (i'm thinking one file) so we have a change of keeping them in sync.",
