How's it supposed to fix it?\n\nWhen I added console.log() calls to handleTouch{Start,Move,End}, I would see Start, only 2 Moves, and no call to End (I was using chrome remote debugging to see the logging).  I believe the browser was taking over the subsequent moves and never calling the End handler.  It is supposed to work by preventing the default touchmove handler from stealing touch movements.  As a result, I then see the touchend event fire, which is where slide.js does the actual page turning.\n\nI've put a copy of this CL up and running at:\n\nhttp://5004-r1.mygoissues.appspot.com/2012/splash.slide#1\n\nTesting again here on my N7 and Galaxy Nexus against that URL seems to work.  The swipe functionality here will not move the page as you swipe, only when you lift your finger will it determine which way you swiped and then move to the previous/next page accordingly.\n\nNote I've only tested with Chrome, there is no 'Browser' app (with the blue globe icon) on your N7 right?\n\nIf you still don't see it working against the appspot URL, I can try instrumenting the page to print out touch events, maybe your seeing a different set of events generated then I am.",

There is now what I would call a snap-to behavior on iDevices.  If we want to be able to have the old iDevice behavior across touch devices, I would need to add some sort of manual translation to the viewport or slide deck within the touchmove handler.\n \n \n> Note I've only tested with Chrome, there is no 'Browser' app (with the blue\n> globe icon) on your N7 right?\n> \n> If you still don't see it working against the appspot URL, I can try\n> instrumenting the page to print out touch events, maybe your seeing a different\n> set of events generated then I am.",
