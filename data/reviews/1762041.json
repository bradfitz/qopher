	"description": "Some functions, most importantly, ForkExec, accept an array of os.File\nand it is essential for some software to use a Conn in that function.\nConn does not currently allow access to the underlying File, hence,\nit is not possible to set up a net-connected process from ForkExec.\nIt is essential for some cluster software to have this capability.\nThis patch, from Andrey, is a suggested way to provide the\nfunctionality. An example of usage:\nfd, _ := l.Accept()\n_, _ = os.ForkExec(\"/bin/ls\", []string{\"/bin/ls\", \"-l\", \"/\"}, nil, \"\",\n\t[]*os.File{nil, fd.GetFile(), fd.GetFile())})\nNote that I was unsure what to do about websockets, and pipes.\npipes have four fds; which to use? Websockets I was just not sure",
