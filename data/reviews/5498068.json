To do this right you really need to be able to\ndescribe the whole collapsed stack of line numbers\ninstead of being forced to pick one.  I don't remember\nwhether DWARF supports that but certainly gdb seems\nnot to be able to tell you anything but the bottom\nline on that stack.  This CL will write down the top\nline instead, and in the limited inlining we're doing,\nI would argue that the top line is more useful.\nAt the least, I've suffered long enough with debuggers\nshowing the bottom line when that information is useless\nthat I'd like to try showing the top line and see whether\nthat has fewer egregious failure modes.\n\nRuss\n",
