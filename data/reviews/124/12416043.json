	"description": "net: implement simple Happy Eyeballs connection setup for TCP\n\n*** This CL includes CL 12414043 for convenience ***\n\nThis CL implements basic functionality of Happy Eyeballs connection\nsetup for TCP as described in RFC 6555.\n\nIt simply runs two Dial racers when the given destination is a DNS\nregistered name and the name has multiple address family records on\nTCP wildcard network \"tcp\". For example,\n\nnet.Dial(\"tcp\", \"www.google.com:http\")\n\nwill return a connection which is established first either TCP over\nIPv4 or TCP over IPv6.\n\nAlso this CL doesn't implement other happy eyeballs related features\nsuch as DNS record caching, DNS resolve racers and TCP connection\npooling.\n\nFixes issue 3610.\nFixes issue 5267.",
