			"text": "Is it really a good idea to set the keepalive time and interval to the same \r\nvalue?\r\n\r\nOn Linux, by default the first probe is sent 7200 seconds after the last \r\ndata and then every 75 seconds. On Windows, the values are 7200 seconds and \r\n1 second.\r\n\r\nI think most people want to decrease the amount of time to the first \r\nkeepalive probe to something below two hours, but want the interval to stay \r\nthe OS default or something short. If this API was used and the period was \r\nchanged to, say, 30 minutes, the connection would take quite long to drop \r\nbecause the OS needs to send many probes. Assuming the OS sends 8 probes, a \r\nconnection with these settings would take 4 hours to die versus 2h10m with \r\nthe OS defaults.\r\n\r\nOSX and BSD don't seem to have the ability to set the interval of an \r\nindividual socket so I don't know if using TCP_KEEPALIVE changes that \r\nparameter.\r\n\r\nGiven these circumstances I would prefer that the interval is not changed \r\nat all even where it is supported and only the keepalive time is changed.\r\n",
