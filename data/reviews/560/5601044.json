	"description": "cgo: Linux/ARM support *PREVIEW*\n     This is an unfinished preview for testers. Not for merging.\n\nCurrent status:\n1. all pkg tests and tests in test/ directory are passed.\n2. all but one tests in misc/cgo are passed.\n   misc/cgo/test used to fail when GOMAXPROCS>1 on SMP ARM machines, but I believe this is fixed now.\n3. cmd/go can handle cgo programs now.\n\nKnown issues:\n1. No thumb library support, you have to make sure your external library is compiled using '-marm'.\n2. The ELF Dynamic linker is hard coded to be /lib/ld-linux.so.3, so on some\ndistributions, like recent Ubuntu and Android, you might need to adjust\nsrc/cmd/5l/asm.c. I plan to add auto detection for this.\n\nNote:\n1. You have to export CGO_ENABLED=1 by yourself. (Update: enabled in Patch\nSet 5)\n2. At this time, it will take some time to set up enviroment to do the tests in misc/cgo. Mainly because the recent removal/rename of some scripts/commands (e.g. quietgcc, gotest; gopack -> pack)\n(Update: the restriction is removed in Patch Set 6)",

But the first option isn't perfect either, users are\nforced\nto set environment vars or set unfamiliar cmdline options.\n\nYet another option is to treat Android as an new OS, at least for 5l. This\nis the\nmost flexible way, but will bring a lot of code duplication.\n",
