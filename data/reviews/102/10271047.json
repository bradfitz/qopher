	"description": "cmd/5l,runtime: External linking support on linux-arm\r\n\r\nThis CL adds support for -linkmode external to 5l.\r\n\r\nFor 5l itself, use addrel to allow for D_CALL relocations to be handled by the host linker. Of the cases listed in rsc's comment in issue 4069, only case 5 and 63 needed an update. One of the TODO: addrel cases was since replaced, and the rest of the cases are either covered by indirection through addpool (cases with LTO or LFROM flags) or stubs (case 74). The addpool cases are covered because addpool emits AWORD instructions, which in turn are handled by case 11.\r\n\r\nIn the runtime, change the argv argument in the rt0* functions slightly to be a pointer to the argv list, instead of relying on a particular location of argv.\r\n\r\nDepends on CL 10499043\r\n\r\nFixes issue 5590.",

Thanks for the review.\n\nHowever, since this CL builds on 10499043 through hg mq I created this CL by forcing codereview, and hg clpatch will probably complain on your side. We'll have to do this in lockstep: When 10499043 is submitted, I'll update this CL (including the $-4 fix) and when this is submitted I'll finally update 9733044 so it can be submitted last.
