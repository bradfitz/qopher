OpenBSD 5.1 did not have\r\nrthreads enabled by default. Additionally, there was a thread related\r\nfix that was committed after 5.1, which is needed to be able to run Go\r\nreliably (from memory, at least one of the tests deadlocks). On the\r\nother hand, OpenBSD 5.2 has rthreads enabled by default and Go works\r\nreliably.\r\n",
