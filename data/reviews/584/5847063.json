When tested, the go tool api command does not catch\nthat windows does not implement any of syslog when there is at least\none file.  The build succeeds.\n\n\n> I think, it has been decided to postpone all these decision till later\n> (http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=1108). Hasn't it?\nAgain correct. Was off topic.
