	"description": "misc/emacs: Added an emacs flymake support module.\n\nFlymake is the emacs minor mode to run basic syntax checking\nover a file as you type. In the case of Go, the go compiler\nfits the job quite well; it's fast, and provides decent error\nmessages. The added file deduces the name of the\nGo compiler from the architecture of the machine. This means\nthat if the machine only has the compiler for a different\narchitecture installed, the mode will fail. It also doesn't\nsupport gccgo, but customisation of the compiler/checker used\nis quite simple (i.e. one line of lisp). The other\nassumption made is that the compiler will be on the system\npath. However, as the mode is optional, I don't think these\nare unreasonable.",

It's command names are architecture-agnostic, so it needs to know about 5g/6g/8g internally.  I was wondering if you could get the information from there.  Come to think of it, you should probably call \"go build\" instead of the compiler itself because that should take care of paths etc.\n\nhttp://weekly.golang.org/cmd/go/",

However, it dosn't seem to solve the multiple file problem, as it can't automatically find all required files for building the package, and if given the package name to build, the $GOPATH needs to be set up correctly, which seems rather complicated. However, I have no experience with it, and I'm not 100% sure which method is prefered.",
