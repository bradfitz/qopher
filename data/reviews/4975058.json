For example, <net/if.h>.  The collision with the keyword if is\nunfortunate.  That is the reason we have an ifnet structure.  It should be\ncalled if but that is a keyword.\n\nTo people outside of networking if might not mean interface, but they are\nalso not the target audience for networking packages/libraries/definitions.\n One might say to most people, go means, well the verb to go ;-)\n\n    -Paul\n\nOn Thu, Sep 8, 2011 at 10:58 AM, Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org> wrote:\n\n> Why?\n>\n> To most people if means, well, if, and not interface.\n>\n",
