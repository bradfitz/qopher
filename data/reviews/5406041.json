Nobody was\nusing it for a real app. There may eventually be some sort of standard\ncross-platform GUI package, but I don't know anyone who is working on\none. Even if there was one, it would probably live outside of the\nstandard library (and could therefore depend on things like xgb if it\nwanted to).\n",
