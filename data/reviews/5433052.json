	"description": "Various: Drop expansion of RCS identifiers in two modules.\n\nI'm sure I'm the only simultaneous user of HG and CVS, but the\nchange is entirely benign.  The problem is that these two files\ncontinue to appear as \"changed\" to a CVS repository.  Freezing\nthe identification tags unexpanded simplifies mechanisation in\nthis environment.\n\nI won't be bothered if the submission is rejected, but please\nremove this paragraph before committing this.",
