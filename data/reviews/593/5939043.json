	"description": "misc/bash: Replace bash script with go comp cmd.\n\nThis now has support for all of the 'go tool' tools, godoc,\nand gofmt. It's also much faster than the bash script, and\ncleaner and easier to modify in the future. It is not, however,\nfully complete. 'go tool pack' doesn't have support for options,\nand pkg listing is a little odd, although it does work. It also\ndoesn't support cmd/<pkg> format completion for godoc, but it\nshouldn't be too much of a problem to implement.",
