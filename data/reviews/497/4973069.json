However we didn't pop the 'z' entry, so\nwe were actually corrupting the history stack.  The most obvious\noccurance of this was in the code that build the symbol tables for the\nDWARF information - where an internal stack in the linker would overflow\nwhen more than a few line directives were encountered in a single stack\n(Issue 1878).  So now we pop the 'z' entry when we encounter the end of\nthe file that the directive was in, which maintains the history stack\nintegrity.\n\nAlso, although new 'z' entries for new files had relative paths\nexpanded, the same was not done for line directives.  Now we do it for\nline directives also - so that the now correct DWARF information has the\nfull path available.\n\nFixes issue 1878.\n\nR=rsc\nCC=golang-dev\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/4938042\n\nCommitter: Russ Cox <rsc@golang.org>\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\n",
