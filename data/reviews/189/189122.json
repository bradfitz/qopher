It hits the two main ones and does say \"or the equivalent on your Linux distribution\".  That paragraph is a bump in the road along the way to installing Go; expanding it makes it feel too much like the main event.  I expect that people on rpm systems already know to type yum, and the package list is almost identical.\n(Similarly, there's no command line for FreeBSD.)",
