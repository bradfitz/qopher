Hopefully reversing the order\nand adding a heading will clear up any remaining confusion.\n\nAlso removed the bit about setting environment variables in Windows since\nthat is already covered in the Windows section.",

It's certainly an improvement, don't get be wrong.

How about moving the GOROOT instructions for all platform to\na separate section called \"Installing to a non-standard location\" ?",
