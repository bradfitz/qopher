Usually backwards compatibility is\r\nretained for a few releases (the official level of support is for the\r\nlast two stable releases).\r\n\r\nSince you are curious, sys_rfork had been slated for removal since\r\nsys__tfork replaced it. As an example of backwards compatibility,\r\nthere are currently syscall two entry points to sys__tfork - one that\r\nis being retained for backwards compatibility (the one that Go\r\ncurrently uses, which I'll fix soon) and the replacement that has a\r\ndifferent interface. Most of the other changes are similar deprecation\r\nand associated clean up.\r\n\r\n> On Tue, Nov 13, 2012 at 6:43 AM, <jsing@google.com> wrote:\r\n>>\r\n>> Reviewers: golang-dev_googlegroups.com,\r\n>>\r\n>> Message:\r\n>> Hello golang-dev@googlegroups.com,\r\n>>\r\n>> I'd like you to review this change to\r\n>> https://go.googlecode.com/hg/\r\n>>\r\n>>\r\n>> Description:\r\n>> syscall: regenerate z-files for openbsd/amd64\r\n>>\r\n>> Regenerate z-files for OpenBSD/amd64 on OpenBSD 5.2.\r\n>>\r\n>> Please review this at http://codereview.appspot.com/6843045/\r\n>>\r\n>> Affected files:\r\n>>   M src/pkg/syscall/zerrors_openbsd_amd64.go\r\n>>   M src/pkg/syscall/zsysctl_openbsd.go\r\n>>   M src/pkg/syscall/zsysnum_openbsd_amd64.go\r\n>>   M src/pkg/syscall/ztypes_openbsd_amd64.go\r\n>>\r\n>>\r\n>\r\n",
