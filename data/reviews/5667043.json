The example is supposed to show a few variations so\nthat the developer can look at the input, compare with the output, and\ninfer what is going on.\n\nWould you mind to leave that with me?  I'll take this example out of\nthe documentation string and into the executable examples file that is\nbeing introduced for Marshal, so that it looks nicer on godoc and it's\nharder for people like me to screw up when updating the code.\n\n-- \nGustavo Niemeyer\nhttp://niemeyer.net\nhttp://niemeyer.net/plus\nhttp://niemeyer.net/twitter\nhttp://niemeyer.net/blog\n\n-- I'm not absolutely sure of anything.\n",
