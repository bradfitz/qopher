The latter may run additional\ntests to boost confidence in the result, but if we find cases\nwhere 'go test' fails while 'go test -short' does not, I believe\nthat must be addressed.  If not, the implication is that a\npackage should be considered working even when 'go test'\nprints FAIL, which is at the least disconcerting.\n\nOriginally the malloc counts were just prints, but at some\npoint we decided that they were important enough to verify\nduring the test.  This has broken the agreement between\n'go test' and 'go test -short' on at least one system, and it\nis that agreement that I believe we should restore.  The two\nways I see to do that are (1) make the test run in -short, or\n(2) make the test only print, not cause a failure (go back\nto the way it was originally).  For me this isn't about counting\nmallocs at all; it's only about making go test and go test -short\nconsistent.\n\nRuss\n",
