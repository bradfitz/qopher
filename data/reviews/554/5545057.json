The blackholeJar currently used makes it impossible to share them between redirects safely.",

Not just pass it on to the next request. If the user passes in a cookie jar, as in issue 2692, then we should be updating it with the cookies we got back from the Get request.\n\nSanjay",

In fact, this way, you might be leaking cookies across domains.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the fix for the issue should have just been to move the loop putting cookies outside of the \"if redirect != 0\".\n\nOr am I missing something obvious...",
