That was a potential DoS.\n\nWith this CL there's a threshold under which we read\n(currently 256KB) in order to keep the connection in\nkeep-alive mode, but once we hit that, we instead\nswitch into a \"Connection: close\" response and don't\nread the request body.\n\nFixes issue 2093 (along with number of earlier CLs)",
