Generally useful information should be there by\r\ndefault, which is why I support the explicit \"race\" label here. But I\r\ndon't think complete information needs to be. The dashboard is very\r\ndense in part because of all the stuff that's hidden behind hovers.\r\nFor example you can hover over any of the CLs first-lines to get the\r\nfull description.\r\n\r\nRuss\r\n",
