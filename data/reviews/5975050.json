It's Go 1.0.1 already, bug the patch is still in limbo. If the original submitter abandoned this patch, should I submit a new one, or is it possible to take over this one?",

But since I'm not CL author I cannot add more\r\ntests, so I created CL 6206090 (different patch, a lot simpler).\r\n\r\nAs for more tests, I have two with /p@th, just to show it doesn't split\r\nthere. Anything else is excessive in my opinion, since it only affects\r\nparsing of authority, and other cases are already tested by other tests.\r\nWould be happy to add more, though, if you feel strongly about it.\r\n",
