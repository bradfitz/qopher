Here's what I'm thinking: \nI can use xcodebuild -version to get the version number and select the source of the copy accordingly. Since xcode 4 made the command-line tools optional though, I'll assume that an error executing that command means that xcode 4 is the version. Otherwise, if the version number is 3.x, the source is going to be xcode/3/*.\n\nIf anyone has a suggestion for a more robust solution, I'm all ears. I actually don't know much about xcode myself aside from needin it for the command-line tools.",
