It now gives you a standard usable repo. I guess this might\r\nmuck with some folk's scripts that worked around the previous\r\nweirdness.\r\n\r\n> Also, this changed from \"master\" to \"origin/master\" in\r\n> codereview.appspot.com/5605045 to address golang.org/issue/2109 (reported by\r\n> adg!). Now it's changing back. Why?\r\n\r\nI think what was pointed out in #1 and #2 in 2109 is exactly right: if\r\nthere are local changes to a checked out package, what should \"go get\r\n-u\" do? That was the behaviour that should have been fixed (pull with\r\n--ff-only is the right solution; it forces you to decide what to do\r\nwith your local changes versus what you are pulling down), and we've\r\nfixed it now. The problem with the previous version was that you got a\r\nbroken local repo that did not allow local changes and it was\r\nconfusing for non-experts to work out how to remedy that situation.\r\n",
