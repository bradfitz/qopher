The\r\nsubmit is using the credentials you stored in your hgrc, which are clearly\r\nworking fine.\r\n\r\nThe second wants a standard Google account and password. The account you\r\nuse here does not have to match the account you use for hg, and the\r\npassword definitely doesn't match (since the hg password is autogenerated\r\ngarbage from code.google.com). If you choose to use an account with 2-step\r\nverification enabled, you will need to paste in an \"application-specific\r\npassword\" at the prompt instead of your real password. If you use an\r\naccount without 2-step verification, you can just type your password.\r\n\r\nRuss\r\n",
