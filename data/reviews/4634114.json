I like flexibility to pick and chose and change things around without thinking it will affect someone else.\n\n> E.g. gobuilder has an archive and upload option.

Or you have to provide an alternative. Look at it like that - you ask Brad or Andrew to produce these 2 files for the next release, they would be able to build exe, but not zip (as per my script). So you have to rectify that issue one way or the other.\n\nKeep it simple, please! <g>\n\nAlex",

Should it be a standalone tool or should it offer\nsome very specific functionality to a client?\n\nIf all it needs to do is build an install executable, where\nthe client provides a go folder that contains the pre-built\ntoolchain, then gobuilder might be that client.\n\nE.g. gobuilder has an archive and upload option. Its \nfunctionality could be extended to do zip files as well,\nand it could also call this tool to build the install\nexecutable. It could upload both the zip and installer\nfiles to the desired distribution site if need be. \n\nPutting together a standalone tool, if that's more\ndesirable, is doable as well. \n\n-joe\n\nOn Jun 30, 2011, at Jun 30 - 9:04 PM, alex.brainman@gmail.com wrote:\n\n> Joe,\n> \n> Your Inno Setup installer script works fine for me.
