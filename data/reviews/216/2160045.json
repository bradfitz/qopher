Was looking at the http docs and noticed they're missing. Granted their utility is limited without auth, but having the base code there and then building the auth on top makes sense, I think.\n\nI gather there are plans to re-do the HTTP stuff. I was going to play a bit more with that code, there is some refactoring that can be done between the methods but I'll hold off if it's going to change anyway.",
