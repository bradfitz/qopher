			"text": "FYI: I've been playing with this. The gob encoded suffixarrays (of\nsufficiently large size) happen to be larger than the corresponding\nbinary-encoded ones (because large 32bit int values tend to use 5\nbytes instead of 4), but gob-encoding appears to be faster (more than\n2x, from a first hand-stopped test). I suspect this is due to the fact\nthat binary encoding does an interface call (little vs big endian) for\neach int32 it encodes, while gob's int encoding is fixed.\n\nAnyway, a CL for a better code (that also does away with the huge\nextra copy) is forthcoming once some gob issues are fixed.\n\n- gri\n\nOn Thu, Sep 15, 2011 at 6:19 PM, roger peppe <rogpeppe@gmail.com> wrote:\n> the other thing gob gives you is future-proofing - it's trivial\n> to upgrade to 64 bits or another format if needed.\n>\n> On 16 September 2011 02:06, Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org> wrote:\n>> It would save space on disk, but I'm not sure it would be faster or\n>> use less memory when reading it in (both of which are the primary\n>> concern here as this is primarily for godoc on app-engine use).
