I am not fond of duplicating over 200 lines and increasing the possibility of having linux and unix potentially have conflicts.  I understand the no new stack segments issue.  I would be half tempted to define SYS_UNSHARE as -1 on non-linux boxes and simply return an EOPNOTSUP if sys.Unshare is set andand SYS_UNSHARE is -1.  The bits for sys.Unshare should only be defined for linux so code using sys.Unshare would still not compile.",

Then hg upload and it will show\nthe diffs against exec_unix.go.\n\nThat said, I am pretty unhappy about having to duplicate\nthis code.  It is super subtle.  What are the changes?\n\nFinally, if there is more than a line or two here\nfrom jdnurmi@qwe.cc we need a completed CLA from him/her.\nSorry about that.\n\nRuss\n",
