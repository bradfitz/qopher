I\nwould expect to see the \"widgets/foo\" package I've created.\n\n- Executing go install inside $GOPATH/src creates the directories under\n$GOPATH/pkg but does not install correctly the package (foo.a is missing).\n\n- There's a typo on doc/code.html on the \"The go tool and GOPATH\" section:\nls $GOPATH/pkg/*/example should be ls $GOPATH/pkg/*/widgets.\n\nShould I fill an issue for each on the issue tracker? If I can contribute\nby changing anything let me know and I will do it.\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 13, 2012 at 11:50, Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@golang.org> wrote:\n\n> Yup.
