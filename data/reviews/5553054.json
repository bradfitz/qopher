There are two, one with some strange stuff in it, the other derived from it and with the strangest bits removed. In core it's more-or-less directly translated from openssl's implementation. \n\nMine's a bit simpler, and more similar to the description in the RFC. Also, it's a bit different from how the other one is invoked. Would like some input on that if that's at all possible.\n\nrsc, agl: I just thought, bcrypt is there too, so why not pbkdf2 too?
