My earlier comments were based on the\nbelief that browsers do _not_ send the :port in the Host line,\nbut I just ran some experiments with Chrome and it seems like\nthey do.\n\nGiven that browsers do include the :port, it seems fine for\nServeMux to use it to direct requests, so I don't think issue 3159\nis a bug anymore.\n\nI just reread the original email, and the only case that seems\nsuspect is trying to handle \":1111/foo\".  That is unsupported now,\nand I think it can probably wait until after Go 1 to make any other\ndecisions.\n\nSorry for the trouble.\n\nRuss\n",
