The panics occur only if you run out of memory, recover is very cheap. Both are part of idiomatic Go.\n\nI don't believe it's as bad as you imply here. Remember that the triggering problem was a panic in ReadFile. I spent some time trying to fix the problem proactively, but all those solutions were messier than this reactive approach. Also this was a sequence of three CLs but the cumulative effect on the code was actually quite small.\n\nUnless you have a truly better solution, I'd prefer to move on.\n\n-rob\n\n",
