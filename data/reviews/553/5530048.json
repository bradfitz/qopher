That's what this and the previous CL seek to prevent.\n\nI agree that it should not be policy to update the examples whenever\ngofmt affects them, though.\n\n>> This CL also fixes the indent in several of the generated HTML files,\n>> so it is definitely an improvement on the status quo.\n>>\n>> Also gofmt caught this unsorted import group:\n>> http://codereview.appspot.com/5530048/diff/5001/doc/progs/echo.go\n>\n> sort them and revert the rest. or don't revert the rest, but understand i have a technical point here.\n\nI'd prefer not to revert the rest, as this CL corrects indentation\nerrors I introduced last week in this CL:\n  https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=904c12a55d8abee2f1b6e19b34f666403d906b63#\n\nAndrew\n",
