			"text": "A few lines of email discussing a change like this would be nice\nbefore writing a CL.  It helps us understand what is going on\nand might help you avoid some work.\n\nIn this case, I don't understand why this change would be appropriate.\nRight now, if you look at any of the blocks set apart by comments\nin the buildscript files, they all stand independently.  For example:\n\n#\n# sort\n#\n\nmkdir -p \"$WORK\"/sort/_obj/\ncd \"$GOROOT\"/src/pkg/sort\n8g -o \"$WORK\"/sort/_obj/_go_.8 -p sort -I \"$WORK\" ./search.go ./sort.go\ngopack grc \"$WORK\"/sort.a \"$WORK\"/sort/_obj/_go_.8\ncp \"$WORK\"/sort.a \"$GOROOT\"/pkg/linux_386/sort.a\n\nWith this CL, I believe the cd argument will be relative to the previously\nbuilt package, which will mean it can change simply because something\nabove it changed (and left things in a different directory).  The stanzas\nno longer stand alone.  That is a significant drawback: the big comments\nin the script are there precisely to make stanzas as independent of each\nother as possible when changes must be merged during an hg sync.\n\nThis drawback would have to be paid for by some compensating virtue.\nWhat is it?\n\nRuss\n",
