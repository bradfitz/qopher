Now that it is gone, i.e.,\n\"InsertSemis\" is on by default, I need a flag (for testing) to turn\n\"InsertSemis\" off. Which is why the new flag needs to have the\ninverted meaning of the old one.\n\nI am hoping to eliminate the flag altogether, but I didn't want to\nfiddle with the somewhat delicate tests (because of position\ninformation etc.) for now.\n\n- gri\n",
