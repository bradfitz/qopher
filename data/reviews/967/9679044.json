I can restore the package and imports here to make it valid.\n\nBut I realize now that the playground won't have access to this import, either, will it?  So the build still won't work.  I believe this means I need to remove the \"realFetcher\" below and this import entirely, correct?\n\nIt would be good to make the real fetcher available separately for people who want to play with this code offline, though.  Can you recommend an organization for this?",
