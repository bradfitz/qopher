I'll just say that every time\nI've wanted to print a call stack, all I've been interested in is the\nfile name and line number\nof each caller, and it's nice if it's all on one line - the Stack\nmethod provided by runtime/debug is overkill\nand makes log files hard to process.\n\nUp to now I've just been copy and pasting the code; I can put it in its\nown package, but that seems a bit like overkill for something so small.\n\nAnother possibility might be to change Stack to take an argument,\na bool or a bit mask, to determine what information to include in its output.\nThat's probably still too featuritisy though.\n\nOn 4 January 2012 19:40, Rob 'Commander' Pike <r@google.com> wrote:\n> This feels featuritisy to me.
