			"text": "> Did you check this on the Mac?\n\nI haven't run tests on a Mac unfortunately, as I don't have an\nenvironment available.  I've run tests on Linux arm/386/amd64 only.\nSorry for not pointing that out.\n\nI did check the logic, though.  domacho also takes -d into account and\ndoes not emit the dynamic sections in that case, so hopefully it will\nwork as intended.  That said, loadlib doesn't change the debug['d']\nflag internally on the darwin head as it does elsewhere, so this\nchange won't be so interesting there.\n\n-- \nGustavo Niemeyer\nhttp://niemeyer.net\nhttp://niemeyer.net/blog\nhttp://niemeyer.net/twitter\n",
