	"description": "go/doc, godoc: improved note reading\n\n- A note doesn't have to be in the first\ncomment of a comment group anymore, and\nseveral notes may appear in the same comment\ngroup (e.g., it is fairly common to have a\nTODO(uid) note immediately following another\ncomment).\n\n- Define a doc.Note type which also contains\nnote uid and position info.\n\n- Better formatting in godoc output. The position\ninformation is not yet used, but could be used to\nlocate the note in the source text if desired.\n\nFixes issue 4843.",

Maybe the synopsis approach will look nicer as the anchor text, so let's just defer that to then.
