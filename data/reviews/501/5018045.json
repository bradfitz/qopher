	"description": "crypto/tls: support SSLv3\n\nIt would be nice not to have to support this since all the clients\nthat we care about support TLSv1 by now. However, due to buggy\nimplementations of SSLv3 on the Internet which can't do version\nnegotiation correctly, browsers will sometimes switch to SSLv3. Since\nthere's no good way for a browser tell a network problem from a buggy\nserver, this downgrade can occur even if the server in question is\nactually working correctly.\n\nSo we need to support SSLv3 for robustness :(\n\nFixes issue 1703.",
