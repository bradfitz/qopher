	"description": "go.exp/locale/cldr: Implementation of cldr package, which provides an API for accessing\nthe XML files in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository. It implements the various\nresolution mechanism, like inheritance and alias resolution.\nThis package is to be used by the table creation tools of the various internationalization\npackages. A modified exp/locale/collate/maketables.go is included in this CL as an example.\n\nNote that this package is partially generated. Changes to the CLDR XML standard are\nexpected to be backwards compatible.  This is typically the case.  However, care should\nbe taken that this is indeed the case when upgrading the CLDR version.\n\nThis CL also fixes several bugs in exp/locale/collate that were the result of not\nhandling inheritance according to the CLDR specs.",
