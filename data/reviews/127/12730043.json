It doesn't matter\nand I will fix the CL description something like;\n\n- For dialers that open active connections, pollDesc.Init will be \n   called before syscall.Connect.\n\nProbably we will revisit this when we support SCTP or MP-TCP\nlike stuff that needs complicated operations for both namespace\nand connection control concurrently, but not now.",
