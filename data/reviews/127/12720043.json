Does `USED` macro can support multi-arguments?\n\nI look the `USED` defined code in the $GOROOT/include/libc.h:\n\n\t/* compiler directives on plan 9 */\n\t#define SET(x)  ((x)=0)\n\t#define USED(x) if(x){}else{}\n\t#ifdef __GNUC__\n\t#       if __GNUC__ >= 3\n\t#               undef USED\n\t#               define USED(x) ((void)(x))\n\t#       endif\n\t#endif\n\n`USED` only one argument, but mem_plan9.c used `USED` with two arguments[2,3,4]:\n\n\tUSED(v, nbytes);\n\nafter C preprocessor:\n\n\tUSED(v, nbytes) -> if(v, nbytes){}else{}\n\tor\n\tUSED(v, nbytes) -> ((void)(v, nbytes))\n\nDoes comma expression (i don't know)?\n\nThanks!\n\nReference:\n\n[1]\nhttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/include/libc.h#369\n\n[2]\nhttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/runtime/mem_plan9.c#55\n\n[3]\nhttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/runtime/mem_plan9.c#61\n\n[4]\nhttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/runtime/mem_plan9.c#67",
