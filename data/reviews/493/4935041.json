			"text": "As stated in the document, the difference between POST and PUT is the\nintended effect on the resource at the URL.\n\nIt is very common for REST style APIs to use POST for insertions and\nPUT for updates. In this case, the body of the request is similar if\nnot identical.\n\nThe code change doesn't change default behavior. It parses the form\nwhen the user asks for the form to be parsed.\n\n-dave\n\nOn Aug 19, 2011, at 6:10 PM, David Symonds <dsymonds@golang.org> wrote:\n\n> Although the code looks correct, I'm unsure whether PUT should be\n> handled like a POST.
