The problem is not due\nto use of SO_REUSEADDR on the listening socket - the issue is that we\nare setting it on all sockets. As a result, the client performs a\nconnect() which results in the allocation of a randomised port number\n- since SO_REUSEADDR/SO_REUSEPORT are enabled the port number is\npermitted to already be in use and the normal duplication checks are\nnot performed. We then attempt to establish a TCP connection using\nthis already in use port number, which fails:\n\n 19425 test.out CALL  socket(PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,IPPROTO_IP)\n 19425 test.out RET   socket 10/0xa\n 19425 test.out CALL  fcntl(0xa,F_SETFD,FD_CLOEXEC)\n 19425 test.out RET   fcntl 0\n 19425 test.out CALL  setsockopt(0xa,SOL_SOCKET,SO_REUSEADDR,0xf84019ea00,0x4)\n 19425 test.out RET   setsockopt 0\n 19425 test.out CALL  setsockopt(0xa,SOL_SOCKET,SO_REUSEPORT,0xf84019ea08,0x4)\n 19425 test.out RET   setsockopt 0\n 19425 test.out CALL  setsockopt(0xa,SOL_SOCKET,SO_BROADCAST,0xf84019ea10,0x4)\n 19425 test.out RET   setsockopt 0\n 19425 test.out CALL  fcntl(0xa,F_GETFL,0)\n 19425 test.out RET   fcntl 2\n 19425 test.out CALL  fcntl(0xa,F_SETFL,0x6<O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK>)\n 19425 test.out RET   fcntl 0\n 19425 test.out CALL  connect(0xa,0xf840186768,0x10)\n 19425 test.out STRU  struct sockaddr { AF_INET, 127.0.0.1:43658 }\n 19425 test.out RET   connect -1 errno 48 Address already in use\n\nThe other (and probably better) solution is to only set\nSO_REUSEADDR/SO_REUSEPORT on sockets that will be listening, probably\nvia the addition of a func setDefaultListenSockopts(fd *netFD) that\nwould be called from ListenTCP() et al.\n",
