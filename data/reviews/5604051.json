What is the context?\n> \n\nWe had a problem with our build in net where test would just hang.\n\nIn the past we had 120s timeout for gotest during build. But now it is gone.\n\nSo I decided to put it back, to bring back ability to crash test so we can see stacktrace and also to have gobuilder to continue with next build.\n\nI just discovered that we have hard coded 10 minutes deadline anyway in \"go test\". So am wandering if I should drop my change now.\n\nAlex",
