	"description": "net/http: add default conservative timeouts to ListenAndServe\n\nUsers are regularly surprised by the build-up of stale\nconnections when putting a Go HTTP server Internet-facing.\n\nWithout HTTP- or TCP-level timeouts, any user closing their\nlaptop lid at a coffee shop creates a connection and goroutine\nthat never goes away.\n\nGiven that ListenAndServe and ListenAndServerTLS are the easy,\n\"just work\" versions, they should probably be unsurprising\nby default.\n\nUsers who want different timeouts (including none) can\nconstruct their own Server by hand, as explained in the\npackage comment.\n\nFor discussion at least.",
