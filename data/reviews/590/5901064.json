My patch still seems to apply to go tip, and tests seem to pass. Is this fix desired?\n\nAre there any problems I need to resolve?\n\nOne problem might be the connection in the cache expiring (proxy server disconnects us) by the time we try to reuse it, so making a request will fail on the first write. Should we make another connection and retry in that case?",
