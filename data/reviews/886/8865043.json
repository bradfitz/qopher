	"description": "publicsuffix: compress table of domain labels\n\nDomain labels contain only a few distinct characters.\nThis CL compresses the combined label string by packing\n4 characters into 3 bytes.  This reduces the total memory\nfootprint of the tables by 11% (46 KiB reduced to 41KiB).\n\nThe speed of looking up a public suffix is not affected.\nDrawback: Source code size is increased and the string of\nlabels is a binary mess.",

I say we abandon the CL. Thanks anyway.",
