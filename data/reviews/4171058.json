It's used for the Computer\nLanguage Benchmarks Game[1], which requires all languages to use the\nsame algorithm, so it would be nice to maintain a version with the\ncurrent algorithm. (I also notice that site's using a slightly old\nversion. Someone should update it.)\n\n[1] http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/\n\n- Evan\n",
