But please be aware that a compiler plugin\nis not obscure functionality. Vim includes similar compiler plugins in\nits runtime files, for Java, Ruby, Perl, Fortran, C, and many more. See\n\":args $VIMRUNTIME/compiler/*.vim\" for examples.\n\nThere's a lot of boilerplate here, true, so what use is this? Well,\n\":make me.com/my/pkg\" compiles the package, parses go build output,\nfills the quickfix list with the errors and then lets you jump through\nthem with \":cnext\". That is Vim's edit-compile-edit cycle documented at\n\":h quickfix\", and that is what the plugin makes possible.",

This code looks like it sets the compiler by default.\n\nA compiler plugin must be activated with the :compiler command, see the\ndocumentation at \":h :compiler\". That is why I suggest using a FileType\nautocommand to automatically activate the \"go\" compiler for Go code.\n\nThis particular line just sets this variable to the name of the current\ncompiler. By convention the name is the same as the filename minus the\n.vim extension. Again, please refer to the documentation at\n\":h write-compiler-plugin\" and the examples in $VIMRUNTIME/compiler.\n\n> My .vimrc is pretty sparse:\n> \n> set autoindent\n> set dir=/tmp\n> set backupdir=/tmp\n> filetype off\n> filetype plugin indent off\n> set runtimepath+=$HOME/go/misc/vim\n> filetype plugin indent on\n\nBy the way, if that really is your vimrc may I suggest something?

The readme isn't 100% accurate there, the \"... off\"\nlines don't have to come before \"set rtp=\". What's crucial is that 'rtp'\nis set before \"filetype plugin indent on\" and that the \"off\" lines come\nbefore \"filetype plugin indent on\".\n\nBut that's just nitpicking.
