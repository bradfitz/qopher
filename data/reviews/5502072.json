It still has a separate form of export filtering\n  for showing the source code version. This needs to be consolidated\n  (perhaps the source form view should just be removed?).\n- Stripping of function bodies (stripFunctionBodies function of\n  godoc.go) is now happening in doc.go (line 176).\n- doc.NewPackageDoc has an extra parameter \"exportsOnly. If set\n  to false, the behavior is as before. This function is only called\n  once in our source code; a gofix module is probably not warranted.\n- Deleted doc.NewFileDoc - was never called.\n\nThis change is mostly a code move w/ some minimal tweaks. It should\nnot cause any changes to the behavior of godoc. It's a prerequisite\nfor extracting anonymous embedded fields.",
