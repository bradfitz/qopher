People shouldn't care about sort\norder if they are using gofmt. They can already group imports with\nblank lines anyway.\n\n\nDave.\n",

We only have knobs for the\nbiggest things (tabs/spaces, etc.). We don't provide knobs for small\nthings such as the number of spaces before a comment, or whether to\nalign values in tagged struct literals. I think this change is on par\nwith that: it's a relatively minor formatting detail.\n\n\nDave.\n",
