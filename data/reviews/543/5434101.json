	"description": "syscall: add TCGETA, TCSETA, TCSETAW and TCSETAF on Linux\n\n    Issue #2322 (syscall.TIOC{G,S}ETA constants missing) was closed with status\n\"WorkingAsIntended\", which is correct. However, the proposed solution\nwas not viable for these users: the platform-specific constants\n(TC{G,S}ETA) are not yet included in the syscall package for Linux.\n\nThis little patch adds TCGETA, TCSETA, TCSETAW and TCSETAF to the Linux\nincarnation of the syscall package.\n\nMore details in the original (closed) issue:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=2322",
