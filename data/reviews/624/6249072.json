	"description": "net: make Addr and LocalAddr return a bound address\n\nWhen a listener takes \"\" or nil as an address, Addr or\nLocalAddr on each listener returns an unbound address.\nThis CL makes the listener returns a bound address in\ncase of wild-wildcard listen.\n\nAlso this CL enables both ListenPacket with \"udp\" and\nListenUDP to run with a wild-wildcard address, \"\" or\nnil.\n\nFixes issue 3548 (again).",

If I want to listen to OSPF on all interfaces, I'll call either ListenIP\r\nwith nil or ListenPacket with \"\". If I need a few listeners on specific\r\ninterfaces, I'll call ListenIP/ListenPacket with an address on such interface.\r\n\r\n> In ListenTCP you had the same if statement in the original hg mail but\r\n> have removed it since then, which I agree with.\r\n\r\nYes, I did that to achieve wild-wildcard listenings.\r\n\r\n> In ListenUDP there was an if laddr == nil that returned an error, and\r\n> you changed it to use laddr = new(UDPAddr). But maybe the whole if\r\n> statement can be removed?\r\n\r\nAre you are suggesting to modify both internetSocket and socket instead\r\nof ListenTCP, UDP, IP?\r\n",

If so, why? What is a \"wild-wildcard\"?\r\n\r\nI agree, seems like I was, or am still confused three thin API layers such\r\nas a) Dial/Listen, b) DialProtocol/ListenProtocol and c) syscall.Socket, etc.\r\n\r\nEspecially I forget the difference btw below cases:\r\nA case of unbound address listen: \"\" -> Addr(nil) -> syscall.Listen w/\r\nSockaddr(nil)\r\nA case of bould address listen: \":0\" -> &TCPAddr{0, 0} ->\r\nsyscall.Listen w/ &Sockaddr{}\r\n\r\nAnyway I will try in another CL and will abandon this CL.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-- Mikio\r\n",
