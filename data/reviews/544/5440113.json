	"description": "math/go: added BitCount() to Int.\n\nTo count the number of bits set in Int, the BitCount() method was added.\nCorresponding bitCount() functions were added to nat.go and arith.go.\n\nThe underlying func bitCount(x Word) (n int) uses the Wegner algorithm.\nIt is not the best algorithm (particularly when there are many 1's),\nbut it is simple and passes written test cases.\n\nThe commented out block of code above corresponds to another\nalgorithm: variable-precision SWAR algorithm. However, this code did\nnot pass the test cases.\nPerhaps it had something to do with integer overflow?\n\nRegardless, the Wegner algorithm worked well and passes all test\ncases added to int_test.go.\n\nThe bitCount function should perhaps return uint64 instead to\nguard against overflow. But the return variable is set as int\nin order to be consistent with the bitLen function and friends.",
