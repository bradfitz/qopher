This solves two things.\n\n1. Multi-line strings where not properly recognized by the code that does indentation, so there was still identation done inside these strings. The second part of the patch solves this.\n\n2. There remained a rare case, where multi-line strings were not recognized. This happened when you added a closing bracket directly after the multi-line string, that last line of the multi-line string got indented. Put one space before the closing bracket, and all seemed to work OK. The problem here was that the check had to be done one more character. (I don't know how to explain this clearly.) The first part of the patch solves this problem.",
