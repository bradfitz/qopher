But sorting them is fine with me.\n\nDitto. Both orderings make sense, but I have a small question. CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS is the order they appear in the command line and also makes sense because CPPFLAGS is \"more important\". They're passed to both C and C++ files, so the most common use case will be defining CPPFLAGS, leaving CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS empty. However,  it seems you prefer to order them alphabetically. Then why is GoFiles in the first place  and SysoFiles before SwigFiles? They seem to be ordered logically rather than alphabetically. Also, is there any de-facto convention on field ordering inside structs when it comes to the go standard library?\n\nRegards,\nAlberto",
