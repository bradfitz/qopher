Therefore, on Windows, lex.c fails to compile with error \"'SIGBUS' undeclared.",

It assumes that SIGSEGV is defined in <signal.h> on all systems and SIGBUS may not be defined in <signal.h> on all systems\n\nIt does effectively assume that lex.c will be compiled and run on the same or a similar system, which means that it's not fully portable. The signals available at run-time are assumed to be the same as those found in <signal.h> at compile-time.\n\nFortunately, I see Russ has come up with a better solution.\n\nOn 2010/07/28 16:19:59, Joe Poirier wrote:\n> This may be nitpicking but what about:\n\n  #include <signal.h>\n  #ifndef __WINDOWS__\n      signal(SIGBUS, fault);\n  #endif\n  signal(SIGSEGV, fault);\n\nThis assumes that signal.h may be safely ignored when determining whether a given signal is defined. It further assumes that all signal.h files on all Windows systems conform, at least in part by defining __WINDOWS__, to the copyrighted Microsoft Windows SDK C header files.\n\nWhen I attempted to use your patch on Windows using MinGW and MSYS, it failed.\n\nPeter",
