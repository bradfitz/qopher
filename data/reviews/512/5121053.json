It just treats HTML tags embedded in scripts as plain text instead of as markup. (Most such tags are actually bogus, caused by less-than signs in JavaScript.)\n\nIf I take the test program from issue 2229 and add the following lines:\n\n\t\tcase html.TextToken:\n\t\t\tfmt.Print(tokenizer.Token().Data)\n\nThe output (with my patch) is:\n\nhtml - head - meta - script - time=d.getHours();\nif (time<10)\n{\n  document.write(\"<b>Good morning</b>\");\n}\nscript\nhead\nbody - body\nhtml\n\n\nAndy",

(vector<string>)\n\nThe HTML5 spec has a lot of complicated rules about the contents of a script element. My patch only implements one of them, but the impression I get is that scripts are a special case:\n\nhttp://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/scripting-1.html#restrictions-for-contents-of-script-elements\n\nAndy",
