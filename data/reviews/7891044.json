We encode it as a\r\nDW_TAG_pointer_type with an element type referring to\r\nDW_TAG_unspecified_type, and it's that second type gdb dislikes. It looks\r\nlike plain gcc encodes a typedef of a void* as a DW_TAG_pointer_type\r\nwithout an explicit element type. We should probably do the same for\r\nunsafe.Pointer. I won't do that in this CL, but you're welcome to try it.\r\n\r\nRuss\r\n",
