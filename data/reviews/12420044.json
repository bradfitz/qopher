I added a (simplistic) test for that in Patch Set 4 -- see TestCloneThenParse in clone_test.go. It passes. What am I missing?\n\n\n> More analysis is required.

This panic can be easily triggered from anywhere using the same technique. html/template is just the only place in the stdlib where it occurs.\n\nMaybe I still misunderstand, but if not, here are the alternatives I see:\n\n  (0) Add parse.Tree.Copy(). Document that it is the only safe way to make copies (missing from this CL). Better, but alas not an option now, convert Tree into an interface.\n  (1) Export the parse.Tree text field, or (ick) provide getters and setters.\n  (2) Seriously degrade ErrorContext when tree is nil.\n\nI'd love to be wrong, though. :)\n\nThanks for your help with this, much appreciated.\n\n-josh",
