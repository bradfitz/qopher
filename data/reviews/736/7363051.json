Especially since it's uncovered a deeper problem...\n\nNow I see why the hint wasn't being passed before: to handle type elision in composite literal elements, which only applies for arrays, slices and maps. Adding the hint as I did means that the hint is used in lieu of an explicit type for structs as well (not permitted).\n\nI'm not sure how best to address this at the moment, will need some additional thought. Perhaps the element type elision check should be pushed up to the outer expression?",
