Here is a comparison to another raspberry pi running this\r\ntest on linux/arm (from a few weeks ago)\r\n\r\nok  \texp/types\t4.606s\r\n\r\nand a comparison with an older arm5 (the freebsd/arm image does not\r\nsupport hardware floating point) host from a few days ago.\r\n\r\nok  \texp/gotype\t22.849s\r\n\r\nYet on this host, the test is a minimum of 100 seconds, probably due\r\nto it's very slow IO, and assertion enabled kernel.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else have any comments on this proposal ?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nDave\r\n",
