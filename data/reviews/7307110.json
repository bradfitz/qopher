This is confusing for people who get breakage in the net package as the error is harmless and most likely unrelated to their build breakage.\n\nGiven the way the test works, by reaching into the guts of the netFD, I can't see a way to silence the error without adding a bunch of code to support the test, therefore I am suggesting the test be removed before Go 1.1 ships.",
