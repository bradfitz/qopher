However, as Read returns a signed type, I think it is correct to put a check here. Would you consider adding a test to keep things honest ?\n\nhttps://codereview.appspot.com/6907060/diff/5001/src/pkg/bufio/bufio.go#newcode289\nsrc/pkg/bufio/bufio.go:289: // The text returned from ReadLine does not include the line end (\\r\\n or \\n).\n'\\r\\n' or '\\n' to match the previous occurrences above.",
