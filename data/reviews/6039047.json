The values of primary weights are unrelated to those of code points.\nDepending on the class of CJK, there are different base offsets for primary weights.  0xFB40 is the most common one.  For the test it doesn't matter which one we pick.\nI added a comment to clarify this.  I also made base a const.\n\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/6039047/diff/10001/src/pkg/exp/locale/collate/build/builder_test.go#newcode19\nsrc/pkg/exp/locale/collate/build/builder_test.go:19: }\nOn 2012/04/24 03:50:32, r wrote:\n> doesn't gofmt put blank lines after each function?\nNope, but I can do so manually.
