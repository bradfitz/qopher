From my reading it dials ra using the source address of la, but la is already bound by a ListenTCP above. Not that I have ever tried, but does this work ?\n\nDave",

Both Listen and Dial functions never tweak their parameters.\r\n(Also POSIX and Windows socket API requires syscall.Sockaddrs instead\r\nof net.ProtocolAddrs.)\r\n\r\n> I also suspect that this will break on windows, similar to what is\r\n> happening in issue 5355.
