	"description": "In json.NewDecoder: if the paramter is also a io.ByteReader, then only read\none byte each time to avoid \"over-feeding\".\n\nAdded a test case to test if the Decoder will over feeding. (Nearly a\nverbatim copy from jdnurmi@qwe.cc, the reporter of issue 1955)\n\nThe performance using ReadByte on BenchmarkCodeDecoder is 1.6M/s; while the\nold version is about 1.65M/s. This change approximately hurts the performance\nby 4%. Test environment:\n        - CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU M 460 @ 2.53GHz\n        - Memory: 6GB\n\nFixes issue 1955",

I will send another mail to this thread after Go 1 is out. In the \nMeantime, I will keep optimizing the code to make it faster.\n\nBTW, I am really exciting to hear that Go 1 is near. We are expecting it \nfor (not too) long time.\n\nThanks,\n-Nan\n> Thanks.\n> Russ\n>\n\n",
