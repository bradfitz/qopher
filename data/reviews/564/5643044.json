If you do, then linking to the\nGo files is fine, as is adding people to the Go A+C just\nfor other repositories (as we will no doubt do eventually\nfor the subrepos).  If you want to keep this as a \"Google Inc\"\nthing, then you need separate files.  It doesn't matter to me\nwhich one you choose.  Reusing \"The Go Authors\" is certainly\neasier and makes it easier to move code back and forth\nif you think that will happen.\n\nI admit that Copyright 2012 The People In The AUTHORS File\ndoes have a nice ring to it.\n\nRuss\n",

All rights reserved.\n\nShould I change those to \"Copyright 2012 The People In The AUTHORS File.\"?\n\n... which I guess is: \"Copyright 2012 The google-api-go-client Authors.\" ?\n",
