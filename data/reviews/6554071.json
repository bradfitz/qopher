	"description": "test: Add rundir, rundircmpout and errorcheckdir commands to testlib and run.go\n\nrundir will compile each file in the directory in lexicographic order, link the last file as the main package and run the resulting program. rundircmpout is an related command, that will compare the output of the program to an corresponding .out file\n\nerrorcheckdir will compile each file in a directory in lexicographic order, running errorcheck on each file as it compiles. All compilations are assumed to be successful except for the last file. However, If a -0 flag is present on the command, the last compilation will also be assumed successful\n\nThis CL also includes a small refactoring of run.go. It was getting unwieldy and the meaning of the run commands was hidden behind argument line formatting.\n\nFixes issue 4058.",

The ./run script runs\r\njust one test at a time and has to invoke subshells and scripts for\r\nall the logic. In contrast, run.go can run multiple tests in parallel\r\nand does not fork nearly as many new processes. The end result is that\r\nrun.go is quite a bit faster, which is why it's the default in\r\nall.bash. Most of the time testlib is entirely redundant. However,\r\nthere are days when everything is broken (for example I changed int to\r\n64 bits on my amd64 system this weekend) and the shell script ./run\r\nlets you at least try the test directory without depending on having a\r\nworking Go implementation.

All compilations are assumed to be successful except for the last file. However, If a -0 flag is present on the command, the last compilation will also be assumed successful\n\nThis CL also includes a small refactoring of run.go. It was getting unwieldy and the meaning of the run commands was hidden behind argument line formatting.\n\nFixes issue 4058.\n\nR=rsc, minux.ma, remyoudompheng, iant\nCC=golang-dev\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/6554071",
