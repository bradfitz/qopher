That is why I made the change. Without changes in the build.go, buildscript.sh generates different build scripts when you run it on windows and when you run it on linux. There is only one version of buildscript/windows_386.sh in the repo.\n\nAlex",

I should be looking at GOHOSTOS value not GOOS.\n\n> I think it is fine to leave this one alone.\n\nNo, it is not. The reason this CL has come up, is that running ./all.bash on windows changes all files in buildscript\\*. If you plan to get rid of these files, I will abandon my changes. Otherwise we need solution one way or the other.\n\nAlex",
