	"description": "net: replace implementatin of file/test parseProcNetIGMP\n\nChanged the internal file type to implement a new interface\ncalled readStringer that bytes.Buffer also implements.\nFixed issue with parseProcNetIGMP incorrectly parsing\n/proc/net/igmp and panicing.  Added test case to test the\ncondition.  The old version is still there to demonstrate\nthe problem.\n\nThe simplest fix, but providing no testing, is to just\nadopt the parsing logic in interface_linux.c.  Alternatively\nthis CL can go in with the _oldParseProcNetIGMP function\nremoved and the igmp_test.go file named in such a way it\nwill only run on linux (to late to research that tonight).\n\nNote that for me the net test still fails.  The panic was\nmasking a different failure (the igmp_tet.go failure is\nexpected):\n\n--- FAIL: TestOldParseProcNetIGMP (0.00 seconds)\n        igmp_test.go:35: paniced\n--- FAIL: TestListenMulticastUDP (0.00 seconds)\n        multicast_test.go:126: IPv4 multicast interface: <nil>\n        multicast_test.go:136: IPv4 multicast TTL: 1\n        multicast_test.go:146: IPv4 multicast loopback: false\n        multicast_test.go:82: \"224.0.0.254:12345\" not found in RIB\n\nfixes issue 2826",
