They could still create a &dbus.Method{...} if they want, but they could also use a helper function to create a Method based on the reflect signature of some method and its Go types.  *shrug*\n\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/4535090/diff/5001/dbus/dbus.go#newcode56\ndbus/dbus.go:56: if len(b) < 3 || b[0] != 'O' || b[1] != 'K' || (b[2] != ' ' && b[2] != '\\r') {\noh, annoying that the ' ' vs '\\r' means you can't just use bytes.HasPrefix.\n\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/4535090/diff/5001/dbus/dbus.go#newcode73\ndbus/dbus.go:73: b, err = ioutil.ReadFile(os.Getenv(\"HOME\") + \"/.dbus/session-bus/\" + strings.TrimSpace(string(b)) + \"-0\")\nbefore you look in this file, aren't you supposed to look at os.Getenv(\"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\")?  Only if that's missing I think then do you look in ~/.dbus/session-bus/",
