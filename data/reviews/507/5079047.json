Tags are meant to be applied\nonce, and stay still.\n\nMercurial doesn't have real tags, per se, since you can't reference\nthem if the .hgtags file in whatever revision you happen to have\nchecked out doesn't mention it. That's the biggest downside of storing\nVCS metadata inside the VCS itself.\n\n\nDave.\n",

This use of tags is a little different to what the concept\nnormally means in version control systems. It works for Mercurial, but\nGit is going to get grumpy. Oh, well.\n",
