The bulk of the\nchanges are additional test cases (parser_test.go).\n\nThe fix exposed a caching bug in go/printer via one of the\nexisting tests, hence the changes to printer.go.\n\nAs an aside, the fix removes the the need for empty lines\nbefore an \"// Output\" comment for some special cases of\ncode examples (e.g.: src/pkg/strings/example_test.go, Count\nexample).\n\nNo impact on gofmt formatting of src, misc.\n\nFixes issue 3139.",
