Do we plan to keep and maintain these packages\nlong-term? We don't expect them to migrate back out of old/, and we\ndon't expect people to actually use them (they aren't in Go 1).\n\nI thought the plan was to simply delete these after Go 1, hence this\nCL. If not, I'm confused about their purpose.\n\n\nDave.\n",
