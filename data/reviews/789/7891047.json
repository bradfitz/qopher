I just tweaked 8l.\n\nThis CL adds TLS relocation to the ELF .o file we write during external linking,\nso that the host linker (gcc) can decide the final location of m and g.\n\nSimilar relocations are not necessary on OS X because we use an alternate\nprogram start-time mechanism to acquire thread-local storage.\n\nSimilar relocations are not necessary on ARM or Plan 9 or Windows\nbecause external linking mode is not yet supported on those systems.\n\nOn almost all ELF systems, the references we use are like %fs:-0x4 or %gs:-0x4,\nwhich we write in 6a/8a as -0x4(FS) or -0x4(GS). On Linux/ELF, however,\nXen's lack of support for this mode forced us long ago to use a two-instruction\nsequence: first we load %gs:0x0 into a register r, and then we use -0x4(r).\n(The ELF program loader arranges that %gs:0x0 contains a regular pointer to\nthat same memory location.) In order to relocate those -0x4(r) references,\nthe linker must know where they are. This CL adds the equivalent notation\n-0x4(r)(GS*1) for this purpose: it assembles to the same encoding as -0x4(r)\nbut the (GS*1) indicates to the linker that this is one of those thread-local\nreferences that needs relocation.\n\nThanks to Elias Naur for reminding me about this missing piece and\nalso for writing the test.",
