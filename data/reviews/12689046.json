A zero signaled a non-pointer\nvalue and a one signaled a pointer value.  Interface values,\nwhich are a effectively a union type, were conservatively\nlabeled as a pointer.\n\nThis change widens the logical element size of the pointer map\nto two bits per word.  As before, zero signals a non-pointer\nvalue and one signals a pointer value.  Additionally, a two\nsignals an iface pointer and a three signals an eface pointer.\n\nFollowing other changes to the runtime, values two and three\nwill allow a type information to drive interpretation of the\nsubsequent word so only those interface values containing a\npointer value will be scanned.",
