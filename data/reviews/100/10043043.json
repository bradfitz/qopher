You create an ipv4.PacketConn from a net.PacketConn, and things like *net.UDPConn implement that interface and they have os resources attached to them. I don't have a lot of experience using ipv4.PacketConn, can you please explain to me how I can avoid leaking resources if we remove the Close method ?",
