They aren't ever going to\r\nbe precisely identical, it's not really feasible when working at the\r\nsyscall level.\r\n\r\nThis feature is mainly for .c and .s files where it is clearly\r\nrequired: 6c and gcc are visibly different, and 6a and as are\r\nradically different.  But I think there may be times where it is\r\nneeded even for .go files.\r\n\r\nIan\r\n",
