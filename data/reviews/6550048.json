It makes the\r\ntwo command lines above mean the same thing instead of different things.\r\nI think we should leave things as they are. Any program using real flags\r\ncan be invoked with -- already, and if you do want to pass -- to the program\r\nit's obvious how to do it right now and less obvious if we add this CL\r\n(you'd have to say -- --).\r\n\r\nThis was proposed before and submitted, but I rolled it back because\r\nI believe it creates more confusion than it solves.\r\n\r\nRuss\r\n",
