When it comes to actually running\nthe test, the gccgo testsuite only looks at the exit status.  It would\nbe relatively easy to support some format of \"expected output\" recorded\nwith each individual test, much as we record the way to run the test on\nthe first line today.  It would not be easy to support golden.out, as\nthe gccgo testsuite runs the tests in parallel.\n\nIan\n",

There is no other way to test, for example, that defer\nof the built-in print function works correctly.\n\nRuss\n",
