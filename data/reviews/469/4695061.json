	"description": "big: added recursive subdivision to nat.string to increase performance 4x to 35x\nfor medium and long length numbers. extended tests in nat_test to stress the new\ncode and added benchmarks for performance analysis and setting the subdivision\nthreshold. (This CL replaces #4634075 since its file info has become lost. The\ncode here reflects changes from reviewer gri's helpful comments.)",
