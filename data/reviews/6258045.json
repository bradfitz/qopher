I'm new to Go and I'm finding that after 2 days of poking \r\naround I already have to patch the distro because of a bug that was fixed \r\nseveral months before the release I installed was cut but wasn't included. \r\nThat doesn't sound great. (Yes, I'm having a good experience otherwise :-).\r\n\r\nSo, how does one ask for this fix to be included into the next release? The \r\nreason I hit this problem is that database/sql's (*Stmt).Query is broken \r\nfor drivers that define a ColumnConverter. I'm using \r\ngocql https://github.com/tux21b/gocql which is unusable without the fix.\r\n\r\nBTW, what is the recommended way to patch a package like database/sql \r\nlocally without installing the whole Go world from source?\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, December 27, 2012 9:23:01 AM UTC-8, minux wrote:\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> On Thu, Dec 27, 2012 at 9:57 AM, <t...@rightscale.com <javascript:>>wrote:\r\n>\r\n>> Pardon my ignorance, but why has this fix not been included in Go 1.0.3?\r\n>>\r\n> FTR, it is not included in go 1.0.2.\r\n> the reason is that the changes is too big to include in a point release, \r\n> and\r\n> nobody explicitly ask for it.\r\n>\r\n> search \"69285ecd63e9\" here:\r\n> https://codereview.appspot.com/6279048/diff/25005/go102\r\n>  \r\n",
