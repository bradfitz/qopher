Feel free to send fixes.\n\n> My Windows installation is in German, and most of the syscall errors I get look\n> like this:\n> \n> 2012/05/23 10:05:50 WSARecv tcp 127.0.0.1:80: error 64 (FormatMessage failed\n> with err=1815)\n\nI know. I feel, \"FormatMessage ...\" bit is just an unhelpful distraction for user that got an error and is trying to understand what happened. So, I want to change it to:\n\n2012/05/23 10:05:50 WSARecv tcp 127.0.0.1:80: winapi error #64\n\nI never had problem with FormatMessage myself, and I originally put \"FormatMessage ...\", so I could see when and why it fails for others. I do know now, and it is not very helpful :-). Nothing I can do about it. So I decided to get rid of it.\n\nAlex",
