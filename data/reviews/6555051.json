At least for clients that support session tickets.\r\n\r\nThe notable exception to that is IE, which only supports old-fashioned\r\nsession ID based resumption. This change does 90% of the work to\r\nsupport that too, but for session IDs you would need read/write shared\r\nstate between the nodes because the server-side is expected to persist\r\nresumption state.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAGL\r\n",
