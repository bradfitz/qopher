I'm open to suggestions, but right now I think the project should be called gccgo (capitalized at the start of a sentence) and the program, in usage examples or other specific references, should be called <code>gccgo</code>.  The GCC project is these days usually called \"GCC\" rather than \"gcc\", but I think I would rather write \"gccgo\" than \"GCCGO\".  I cleaned this up in the rest of the doc.\n\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/5673080/diff/1/doc/gccgo_contribute.html#newcode43\ndoc/gccgo_contribute.html:43: Changes to these directories always flow from the master sources to\nOn 2012/02/17 07:16:19, r wrote:\n> \"master sources\" is undefined\n\nDone.\n\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/5673080/diff/1/doc/gccgo_contribute.html#newcode85\ndoc/gccgo_contribute.html:85: main Go repository are run using the DejaGNU script found in\nOn 2012/02/17 07:16:19, r wrote:\n> s/are/is/\n\nDone.",
