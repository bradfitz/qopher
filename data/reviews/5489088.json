I also believe that this project should be completely rewritten (especially for better error handling). I don't use xgb for serious stuff. I try write simple WM in Go, mainly for fun: https://github.com/ziutek/mdtwm \n\n> http://codereview.appspot.com/5489088/diff/4006/xgb/go_client.py#newcode312\n> xgb/go_client.py:312: if func_name == 'SendEvent':\n> The protocol itself calls this SendEvent, so I'd prefer to keep that name.\n> Instead, I'd rename what you currently call SendEvent to just Send.\n\nOK.\n\n> http://codereview.appspot.com/5489088/diff/4006/xgb/xgb.go#newcode375\n> xgb/xgb.go:375: // If you need to send data put them only in one field and\n> This seems to be an unrelated change.\n> \n> But also, all-zeroes can be valid client message\n> data, but your design won't let you send that.\n\nIf all DataX contains only zeros, the zeros from Data8 are copied.\n\nThree was another bug in my putEvent, I fixed it to.\n\nI'll send fixes, but I do not care to found it in official v1 repository. Instead, I waiting for v2.",
