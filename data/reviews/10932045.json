The output of that specific command is unchanged by this CL and\r\nis:\r\n\r\n$ go test -coverpkg strconv fmt\r\nok      fmt     0.038s  coverage: 64.9% of statements in strconv\r\n$\r\n\r\nThis change only affects the print when the package name is printed on the\r\nnext line (during go test with no package argument) or you just ran the\r\ntest binary by hand. In fact it makes all the output more regular: you get\r\nexactly the same \"coverage: ...\" text when running the test by hand that\r\nyou do in the 'go test' summary.\r\n\r\nRuss\r\n",
