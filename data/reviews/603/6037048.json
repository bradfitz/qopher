Depends on the policy of where\never they're running. Corporate tends to lag behind, people I know\ntend to go so far as to run snapshot releases (but I know more OpenBSD\ndevelopers than vanilla users, so this might be skewed). I would say\nthat this really doesn't matter much until rthreads are enabled by\ndefault as Go can't work effectively until then and it's hard to say\nyou support an OS if it's not working OOTB.\n\nLGTM and /agree with targeting 5.2.\n\n--dho\n\n> On Mon, Apr 23, 2012 at 10:22 AM, <jsing@google.com> wrote:\n>>\n>> FTR OpenBSD 5.1 is the next stable release, which will be available from\n>> the 1st of May 2012.
