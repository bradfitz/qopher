For instance, if [:] is permitted, then we probably\nwant to remove the exceptional case rule that makes &a assignment compatible\nwith a slice type if a is an array.\n\nSo let's leave this simmer for a little and see if anything else comes up\nthat might need consideration within this context.\n\nThanks.\n- gri\n\n\nOn Mon, Dec 7, 2009 at 3:24 PM, Robert Griesemer <gri@golang.org> wrote:\n\n> This is a language change, and an issue has been filed.
