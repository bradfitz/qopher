The goal is to set gomaxprocs>1 only after the initial goroutine has called LockOSThread, so that it stays on the main thread. After that all other goroutines launched by init()/runtime are free to travel between OS threads.\nDoes that look OK?\n\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/5732057/diff/1003/src/pkg/runtime/proc.c\nFile src/pkg/runtime/proc.c (right):\n\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/5732057/diff/1003/src/pkg/runtime/proc.c#newcode234\nsrc/pkg/runtime/proc.c:234: main\u00b7init();\ninit() runs here.",

A dozen of worker threads can be multiplexed onto single CPU, so setting maxcpu to 1 does not limit number of worker threads - main thread can block in a syscall and then another thread will be created.",
