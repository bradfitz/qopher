	"description": "gotour: achievement system\n\nAdded a simple achievement system to keep new gophers motivated.\nThe achievement bubbles are displayed on the bottom right corner and\nmultiple bubbles will stack automatically on top of each other.\nYou can test this functionality by running the program on slide #14\nwith an empty localStorage.\n\nThis CL only introduces 6 example achievements, but the plan is to\nadd quite a lot of them. Feel free to propose additional achievements!",

If we're going to introduce achievements, they should be well-designed and valuable as a learning tool.\n\nNot saying yours aren't. I just haven't digested your approach yet.",
