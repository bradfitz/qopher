			"text": "Fair enough.  I do have some changes I was working on, but have not completed.  Namely, the addition to serializePublicKey.  I was considering a few options,\n\n1. Add a behemoth amount of code as another case in serializePublicKey.\n2. Create a separate serializePublicCertificate function.\n3. Create a \"raw []byte\" field in these new structs that contains the already serialized form of the certificate.\n\nAccording to PROTOCOL.certkeys:\n\"The serialised wire encoding of these certificates is also used for storing them on disk.\"\n\nThe only real difference is that the disk form is a base64 encoded version of the serialized bytes.  And that is simple enough to convert.\n\nSo, I am thinking that #3 might be the way to go, but can you think of a reason why we would need a way to generate a certificate?  For now, I imagine certificates will either come from disk or over the wire (network or ssh agent).  In those cases, the certificates would only need to be unmarshaled.  The serialized form could be stored in the raw field.  If there is a plan to generate certificates, maybe it should be later down the road that we add serialization functions necessary for when the raw bytes were not already available.\n\nThoughts?\n\nOn 2012/01/22 09:20:54, dfc wrote:\n> Hi,\n> \n> This looks pretty straight forward to me but I would like to see how you are\n> planning on integrating this authn method into the package.
