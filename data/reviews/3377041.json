			"text": "I don't think special casing 0 to 63 is such a good idea. Exp2 will still be inaccurate for most arguments. I think problem is x*Ln2 isn't precise enough when x gets larger than \u00b11. I have a version which does argument reduction before calling Exp and it seems to behave well. I'll try and get a CL up soon.\n\nThe tests probably don't need all those conversions; testing that Exp2(float64(n))==Ldexp(1,n) should suffice. And n should range from -1022-52 to 1023.\n\nI think it's worth looking into using SSE in the ASM version. The SSE version of Exp is faster than the x87 version. Converting it to Exp2 may be the way to go.",
