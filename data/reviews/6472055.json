Now that you point it out, it does read oddly, but changing it to not include \"keep-alive\" would be dropping the main point.  HTTP/1.0 TCP connections close by default after a response, unless both 1) the client requests \"Connection: keep-alive\", and 2) the server's response includes an explicit Content-Length.\n\nI put \"keep-alive\" in quotes, though, to make it obvious that it's a special term and not just an adjective.\n\nhttps://codereview.appspot.com/6472055/diff/5001/src/pkg/net/http/server.go#newcode518\nsrc/pkg/net/http/server.go:518: // HTTP/1.1 chunked response closing immediately with a zero EOF chunk.\nOn 2012/08/26 13:28:32, r wrote:\n> \"zero-length\"?\n> \n> i find this comment unclear.\n\nAdded the missing word and reworded a bit.",
