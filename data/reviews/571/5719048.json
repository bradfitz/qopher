	"description": "go get: Add a flag to assigning a tag for fetching packages.\n\nThe tool '''go get''' follow this rule:\n\n> If the package has a tag that match the local version with go,\nthe tool only get this matching version.\n\nEg. The go's version is \"weekly.2012-02-22\". The package has a tag\n\"go.weekly.2012-02-22\" and the HEAD is an other different branch.\n\nThe go tool always install \"go.weekly.2012-02-22\".\n\nOf course, I could tag the HEAD as \"go.weekly.2012-02-22.1\" or just\ndownload the package into local disk and install it manually to\nsolve this problem. But dose not look very good.\n\nSo I add a flag to the get command, it can assign a tag for fetching:\n\n> go get -tag HEAD github.com/foo/bar\n\nBy default, the closest matching rule will be used.",
