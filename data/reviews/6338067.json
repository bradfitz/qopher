	"description": "encoding/json: Marshal a map with numeric keys.\n\nJson package only accept a string keys map to encode currently.\nThere will be an error when encoding a map with numeric keys.\nEg. [http://play.golang.org/p/11oo0H0NtE]\ngot \"json: unsupported type: map[int]string\"\n\nIn developing, it is common that using a map with numeric keys.\nThen we must copy & convert numbers into strings befor encoding into json.\nIt is not convenient.\n\nThis patch was created for encoding the map with numeric keys into json.\n\nSorry for my English. Hope I have explained it clearly.",

			"text": "Hi,\n\nI understand what you're trying to do, but we have to draw a line somewhere in the generic JSON representation. I don't actually understand why string-number-keyed maps are so common in your app, but it seems like using the strings should not be that big a hardship, especially if you write a simple helper function.\n\nEach JSON construct has exactly one Go type that is used for the default unmarshal (when there's no other type information) and recognized when marshaling. For arrays it is []interface{}. For objects it is map[string]interface{}, because the object keys are required to be JSON strings.\n\nI would suggest trying to use data structures instead of string-number-keyed maps anyway. You'll be much happier with package json converting between data structures and JSON instead of using these generic forms.\n\nThe video at http://research.swtch.com/gotour shows an example of what I mean.",
