The following sequence of events leads to error:\n   - add fd1 to epoll\n   - dup fd1 = fd2\n   - close fd1 (not removed from epoll since we've dup'ed the fd)\n   - dup fd2 = fd1 (get the same fd as fd1)\n   - add fd1 to epoll = EEXIST\n\nSo, if fd can be potentially dup'ed of fork'ed, it's necessary to explicitly remove the fd from epoll set.",
