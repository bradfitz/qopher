			"text": "Maybe we can further split this up, so the builder goes into\r\ngo.tools/cmd/go similarly to godoc and then the appengine application logic\r\ngoes into its own repo similar to talks/blogs/etc? This might make sense\r\nsince the appengine code for the dashboard and the builder itself aren't\r\nreally related. People should be able to just attempt building Go on their\r\nmachines and not really think about the dashboard unless they are given a\r\nbuilder's key.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Jul 31, 2013 at 10:57 AM, Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@golang.org>wrote:\r\n\r\n> R=adg\r\n>\r\n> Currently we have commands under cmd and packages under the root.\r\n>\r\n> This is neither a command-line tool, nor a package.
