At\n\nHmm, I think I can see such a case. If one manages to convince the\nbrowser that a given Javascript file is actually HTML somehow, a\nredirection onto such a file could lead the browser to do something\narbitrarily bad due to user-provided content that is inside the\nfields.\n\n> best, your change is z performance optimisation, right?

I'm happy to drop this.\n\n-- \nGustavo Niemeyer\nhttp://niemeyer.net\nhttp://niemeyer.net/plus\nhttp://niemeyer.net/twitter\nhttp://niemeyer.net/blog\n\n-- I'm not absolutely sure of anything.\n",
