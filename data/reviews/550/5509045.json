So far we had no problem reports about that.\n\nI had problem: use Oracle ODBC driver with Go, also someone report Go\nprogram crash on windows to me, and confirm use dynamic TLS solve the\nproblem. Some software will let OS auto load some dll even our program\ndon't use these dll, if these dll use static TLS will run into\nproblem, so use dynamic TLS should be stable. Please try load I give\nthe t.dll example, Go program will crash.\n\n\n>\n> http://codereview.appspot.com/5509045/\n",

			"text": "Guys, what about changing it so that we use the ArbitraryUserPointer in the TIB for thread-local storage: http://www.nirsoft.net/kernel_struct/vista/NT_TIB.html.  For example on x86 it is located at 0x14(FS).  No DLL will be using this location, I can guarantee it.  It is a kind of free TLS slot for user applications, as described by http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=98: \"Normally, the ArbitraryUserPointer field is reserved exclusively for use by user mode as a sort of \u201cfree TLS slot\u201d that is available at a known location for every thread.\"",
