			"text": "Agree. I'll write something up.\n\nAlso I have been ruminating on this over the weekend. This code requires a\nnet connection to build- not just install- packages from google code, bit\nbucket, and other aribtrary sites. That's because goinstall uses the remote\nsite to figure out which vcs to use. I have a plan to have goinstall check\nthe local repo first, if it exists. It's a bit of refactoring, but it'll be\ncleaner in the end.\n\nHowever, I'd like to get this change in for now. We can deal with the path\nchange in another cl.\n\nOn Tuesday, 8 November 2011,  <rsc@golang.org> wrote:\n> This looks fine but is inconsistent with the existing URLs.\n> I think we need to break with the past and convert from\n> foo.googlecode.com/hg to code.google.com/p/foo,\n> but we need a plan for doing that.\n>\n> I'd like to understand that plan before pushing this change.\n> It is obviously a sweeping change.\n>\n> It should not be too hard to do a gofix for the conversion\n> now that imports get sorted.\n>\n> http://codereview.appspot.com/5343042/\n>\n",
