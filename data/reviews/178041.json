It seems like\nit would be a pretty useful module.\n\nBesides xml and json, Yaml is definitely worth pursuing, but it's more\ntricky to implement. I needed something simple for my other go project\n(web.go), so ini files seemed like the best answer.\n\n- Mike\n\nOn Wed, Dec 16, 2009 at 12:52 AM,  <rsc@golang.org> wrote:\n> I'm not sure what to do about this.\n> There are so many different config file formats\n> and so few standards. \u00a0We can't reasonably add\n> support for them all, though I think the ones that\n> have standards and implementations in multiple\n> languages are worth pursuing. \u00a0Unfortunately,\n> those are the complicated ones.\n>\n> I've just been using raw JSON files to avoid these\n> issues, but I understand that's not really a tenable\n> long-term solution.\n>\n> http://codereview.appspot.com/178041\n>\n",
