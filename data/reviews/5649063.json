			"text": "No, thanks. We're too close to Go 1 but I wouldn't be in favor anyway. First, the flag package doesn't need this kind of feature creep. Second, there's no way to handle parse errors, so the code just panics the program if the user makes a typing mistake. (You don't even show the user the error.)\n\ntime.Duration is a fine type for a flag, and it works well. The other flag types all get defined using the value type they implement and I see no reason that time should be treated differently. The caller is capable of parsing the time.\n\n-rob\n\n",
