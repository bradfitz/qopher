These values are not directly exposed to the user, but\n                  rather are used to distinguish between the case where the\n          user explicitly specifies, for example, Zzzz vs not specifying it.\n        - The nil-value for ID now identifies Root.\n        - Use Zyyy (undetermined) instead of Zzzz (uncoded, as used by CLDR) as\n          the code for an unspecified script.

With the new semantics is choice is somewhat\n          arbitrary, so we stick with BCP47.\n        - Added error to Canonicalize to accommodate future canonicalization algorithms.\n        - Removed Parent and Written as their semantics are rather hazy.\n        - Added Confidence to Language method as well.\n        - Removed Scope methods.
