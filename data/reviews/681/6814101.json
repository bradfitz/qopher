Apart from (minor) performance concerns, I thought what we had worked well, and I worry that this is a large change where a small fixup to missing comments would do.\n\nI think inside this CL there is a smaller CL trying to get out. For example, the net_posix.go -> net.go change looks good. \n\nCheers\n\nDave",
