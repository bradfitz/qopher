The len function returns the number of bytes. What you want\r\nisn't even the number of characters but the display width, for which there\r\nis no function at all.\r\n\r\n2) Fixed-width display fonts\r\n>>\r\n> If you're not using a fixed width font, the columns won't be aligned to\r\n> begin with, so this doesn't change anything.\r\n>\r\n\r\nFair enough, but then if it doesn't change anything there's no value in it\r\nfor me at least.\r\n\r\n3) Characters all have the same width\r\n>>\r\n> Apart from tab, which is not allowed in identifiers, is there any\r\n> character of different width when using a fixed-width font?\r\n>\r\n\r\nCharacters from other languages are rendered at different widths even with\r\na fixed-width font.  I attach a tiny screen grab from a standard fixed-font\r\nterminal window. The Japanese characters are two columns wide yet occupy\r\nthree bytes when stored in a Go string and so have len()==3.\r\n\r\nAs I said, you are making unwarranted assumptions.\r\n\r\n-rob\r\n",
