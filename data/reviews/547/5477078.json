	"description": "    leveldb/log: added a package for reading and writing log files.\n\nFirst draft of a log package for the leveldb-go port. The format\nis identical to the C++ implementation and this implementation is\nalso quite similar. All credit goes to the original authors.\n\nThe current implementation is only based on an io.Reader /\nio.Writer so it has no direct control of the file offset (especially\nin error cases), the buffer or the flushing / syncing of the log\nfile. Those features might be added later.",

			"text": "See http://codereview.appspot.com/5485075 for my take on it. In particular, my take...\n\n...has a lot more commentary.\n\n...re-uses a block-sized buffer over the lifetime of a reader or writer, instead of making many temporary allocations.\n\n...doesn't export some implementation details (e.g. the record type constant names do not start with a capital letter).\n\n...doesn't use a sync.Mutex. Like typical io.Reader / io.Writer implementations, it is up to the caller to manage concurrency, possibly by selecting on channels.\n\nFinally, it exposes a sequence of io.Reader and io.Writers, instead of sequences of []bytes. This difference isn't a no-brainer. Using []byte might be easier if all records are short, and leveldb log entries are indeed short. But I think that in general it can be useful to support longer records without requiring the whole thing to be in memory, and again it should result in fewer temporary []byte allocations. It also lets you do things like fmt.Fprintf directly to a record.",
