	"description": "There are C library functions including some\r\nstandardised by POSIX that require setting errno to\r\nzero and examining it after calling the function in\r\nquestion to differentiate between errors and other\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAn example is getpwuid(), where to tell the difference\r\nbetween a user-id for which there is no information\r\nand an error, the standard says this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7990989775/xsh/getpwuid.html\r\n\r\n\t\"Applications wishing to check for error\r\n\tsituations should set errno to 0 before\r\n\tcalling getpwuid(). If getpwuid() returns a\r\n\tnull pointer and errno is set to non-zero, an\r\n\terror occurred.\"\r\n\r\nIt can be argued that library functions should not use\r\nerrno (a position I agree with) but it can also be\r\nargued that it's too late now, particularly for\r\nfunctions specified by standards and functions from\r\nthird party libraries for which a developer may not\r\nhave the source.\r\n\r\nThere has been a thread discussing this issue on the golang-nuts\r\nmailing list:\r\n\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/5ef21e2af40a03e\r\n\r\nFrom that thread, the most succinct comment was made by Russ Cox:\r\n\r\n\"C makes it safe by making errno a thread-local variable\r\nin a threaded program.\r\n\r\n\"Cgo can easily, and should, make it equally safe.\"\r\n\r\nI'm opening this issue so that the discussion is not\r\nlost, and in the hope that at some future time I or\r\nsomeone else will be able to address it.\r\n\r\night now I don't know what code changess are needed.\r\nAs the issue tracker requires a diff, I have settled\r\nfor a diff that adds a TODO to src/cmd/cgo/main.go,\r\nwhich I cheerfully admit is a cop-out!\r\n\r\n[ Edit: found what I should have done, and have now opened issue 709 http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=709&colspec=ID%20Priority%20Status%20Owner%20Reporter%20Summary and referenced this CL. ]\r\n",
