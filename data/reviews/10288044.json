Additionally\r\nexisting examples in example_test.go don't appear on godoc or similars.\r\n\r\n> Even it's the case, I still don't understand why having example is a\r\n> bad thing.\r\n\r\nHaving good examples is pretty nice. I mean, I wrote bad examples\r\nthat doesn't appear on on-line documents. So let's drop such useless\r\nexamples.\r\n",
