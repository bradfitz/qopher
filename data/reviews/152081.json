Please create a new change with these two files in it,\nto keep it logically separate from the sort.\n\nYou can do this with\n\n    cd $GOROOT\n    hg file -d 152081 CONTRIBUTORS AUTHORS\n    hg change\n\nThe first hg command dissociates the two files\nfrom the current change; the next command will\nlet you create a new one.  Thanks.\n\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/152081/diff/15/1012\nFile src/pkg/sort/sort.go (right):\n\nhttp://codereview.appspot.com/152081/diff/15/1012#newcode188\nsrc/pkg/sort/sort.go:188: func SortInts(arr []int) {\nThanks for taking the time to write this up.\n\nDo you know how much of the speedup here is due to using radix sort instead\nof quick sort and how much is due to not having to make interface calls?\n\nI'm hesitant about special casing SortInts.  Why not SortFloats too?\nSortStrings?  SortUints?  SortInt64s?  Where does it stop?\n\nI'm also hesitant about radix sort itself.  If the input is small, the\nspeed doesn't matter, and if it is large, the allocation of the second\narray the same size may outweigh the speed improvements.\n\nAlso, in the current package, SortInts is just a convenience wrapper\nfor Sort(IntArray(a)).  It seems odd that SortInts(a) and Sort(IntArray(a))\nare now different implementations.\n\nI need to think more about whether the special case belongs in a\ngeneral library.  Maybe there is a more fine-grained speedup that\ncould be done, like picking off types like IntArray in doPivot.\n(On the other hand, pivoting is a pretty subtle operation; making many\ncopies of it seems error prone.)",

			"text": "Thanks for writing this, but we've decided not to add it to the\nsort library, at least not yet.  The main problem is that it is\ntoo specialized: why not provide the other integer types too? \nBut doing that would mean many copies of the same code,\nand sorting large arrays of integers numerically is much rarer\nthan sorting richer data structures.  The current Sort is admittedly\nslower but much more general.\n\nIt may make sense to revisit this issue once we understand\nhow Go will address generic programming, but for now we're\nbeing conservative.\n\nI hope you're having fun programming in Go.",
