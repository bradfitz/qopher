	"description": "net/http/fcgi: fix a shutdown race\n\nIf a handler didn't consume all its Request.Body, child.go was\nclosing the socket while the host was still writing to it,\ncausing the child to send a RST and the host (at least nginx)\nto send an empty response body.\n\nNow, we tell the host we're done with the request/response\nfirst, and then close our input pipe after consuming a bit of\nit. Consuming the body fixes the problem, and flushing to the\nhost first to tell it that we're done increases the chance\nthat the host cuts off further data to us, meaning we won't\nhave much to consume.\n\nNo new tests, because this package is lacking in tests.\nTested by hand with nginx.  See issue for testing details.\n\nFixes issue 4183",
