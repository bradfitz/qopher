Before a round up, it just wastes a word.\n\nThe effect was that a 6c function with one local and\none two-word function call used (8+8)+(16+8) = 40 bytes\ninstead of 8+16 = 24 bytes.\n\nThe wasted space mostly didn't matter, but one place where\nit does matter is when trying to stay within the 128-byte\ntotal frame constraint for #pragma textflag 7 functions.\n\nThis only affects the C compilers, not the Go compilers.\n\n5c already had correct code, which is now copied to 6c and 8c.",
