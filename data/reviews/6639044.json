In general (for very large tables), that's a good thing because it prevents things such as comments to be very far on the right just because of a single long entry on the left far away.\n\nOne could refine this of couse; for instance in this case the number of entries is below a certain threshold (say 10, arbitrarily chosen), and thus perhaps in this case a different approach should be used.\n\nLeaving as is for now.",
