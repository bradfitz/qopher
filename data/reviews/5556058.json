As Go 1 is getting closer, I can understand if this won't make it, but I think this is the right thing to do.\n\nThis change doesn't add to the Go 1 release notes. Can someone else do that if this change makes it through?\n\n-Luit",

I'm on Central European Time (Europe/Amsterdam time). \n\nKeep in mind that the gofix written is my first, and I don't have much experience with language parsing, so any input on that part is welcome!\n\n-Luit",
