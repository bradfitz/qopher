	"description": "install: convert GOROOT and GOBIN Windows-style paths to Unix-like paths\n\nGOROOT and GOBIN paths are used to build the Go toolchain and\nprograms.\n\nTo build a Go program on Windows, the paths should be valid Windows\nfull paths, starting with the drive letter and a colon e.g. C:\\go\\bin\nor c:/go/bin.\n\nOn Windows, the Go toolchain is built using the MSYS/MinGW Unix-like\ntoolchain. MSYS knows that it must convert a Windows-like PATH to a\nUnix-like path. MSYS does not know that it should convert\nWindows-like GOROOT and GOBIN paths to Unix-like paths, so we\nhave to do the conversion.\n\nRob Pike's windows_path function has been revised to convert Windows\ndrive letters to lowercase.\n\nFixes issue 1734.\nFixes issue 1735.",
