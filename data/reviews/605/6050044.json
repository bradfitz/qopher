	"description": "go.crypto/ssh: drop net parameter from ClientConn.DialTCP\n\nThe net parameter is used by Dial(net, addr string) to pass\na hint to net.ResolveTCPAddr. DialTCP does not use the net\nargument as it already has all the information it needs in\nladdr and raddr. Additionally the tcp4/6ness of laddr/raddr\nis lost when the addresses are transmitted as strings, the\nremote host will use it's best judgement when connecting.",
