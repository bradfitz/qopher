	"description": "    time: added Duration conversion example.\n\nI'm learning Go, and today I needed to create a time.Duration from a variable, but I couldn't figure it out from the docs. I eventually found the answer in an rsc comment on a CL:\nhttp://mail.codereview.appspot.com/5505064/#msg9\n\nThis example is based on that comment. Please consider adding it to the documentation to help future searchers. Thanks!\n\nFixed by: 5696078",
