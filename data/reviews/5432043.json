I guess an alternative is to spin in the fax\ncode, but I think its general appeal is marginal.\n\nI didn't use graphics-go because I don't see that as my dumping\nground, and its initial scope was narrower (image transformations, but\nnot image formats), although recently it has spread its wings wider. I\nalso don't think that the overhead of different repositories is\nparticularly high, and goinstall makes it easy to install any\ndependencies that are in separate repos. Maybe my experience with\nmultiple repos differ from yours.\n\nAs for waiting, I'm happy to wait if it's not blocking anyone (the\nspin-out was in response to someone trying to contribute an image/fax\npacakge). I must admit that I haven't read up on the subrepos details.\n\nAs for freetype-go, its license (the same as C++ Freetype's license)\ndiffers than Go's (and graphics-go's).\n",
