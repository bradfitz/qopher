Why should this repo be different?\n\nIt's because when there's already junk generated by vim, vim generates even more junk. But I noticed that it's wrong, anyway: when vim finds .swp, it creates .swo, then .swn, .swm, .swl, etc.\n\nI will send anoter patch set with just .swp to match main repository. Or should I abandon the CL?",

The .hgignore file should only be used to ignore files\r\ncreated by the project's build system.\r\n\r\nTo avoid checking in your vim temporary files, you (and in this case,\r\nI) should set your own global ignore rules in $HOME/.hgrc with the\r\n'ignore' keyword.\r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n",
