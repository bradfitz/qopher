* Issues with owners should be closed. Only Open Priority-Triage
  without owners should be considered open.

  David says:
  "I just got
  issue.5128: cmd/gofmt reformats block comments
  appearing on my front page, but it was assigned to gri months ago
  (though still with Priority-Triage). It seems like an issue owner
  should own the issue, even if not prioritised."

* handle "ping" in two ways: if it's from a golang/google person: make it
  be a mute (or a temporary logical close) until there's activity again

* add a codereview wait action? Q=wait

* in codereview, notice a R=foo after the last datastore task assign time 
  and reassign the qopher task to match
