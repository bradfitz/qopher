* Issues with owners should be closed. Only Open Priority-Triage
  without owners should be considered open.

  David says:
  "I just got
  issue.5128: cmd/gofmt reformats block comments
  appearing on my front page, but it was assigned to gri months ago
  (though still with Priority-Triage). It seems like an issue owner
  should own the issue, even if not prioritised."
